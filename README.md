Beyond my technical pursuits, Iâ€™m also a creative at heartâ€”I enjoy drawing and appreciating artwork. Every day, I strive to improve myself and my skills, knowing that my only competition is who I was yesterday.

Iâ€™m driven by the desire to make a difference, exploring new ways to build projects that help others. I also love reading, as many things fascinate me.
